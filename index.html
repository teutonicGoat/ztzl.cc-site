        <p>This is my "dev" page for raw learning, where I make a lot of mistakes.<br>If you are looking for something I've created that's a little more polished, please visit <a href="https://zatozolu.com">zatozolu.com</a></p>
        <p style="color:red;">Since you're still reading, here's a goat like me:<br><img src="_90e4347e-ecf5-4520-a2e0-3c3bbe86b828.jpg" alt="GoatMan from Bing Image Creator" width="640" height="640"</p>

        <!--Here's a comment line>
        In fact, it can be multiple lines too!-->
        <p>This is <del>deleted</del> text and this is <ins>inserted</ins> text.</p>
        <p>Here is a <sub>subscript</sub> and here is a <sup>superscript</sup></p>
        <p>Here is an example of a blockquote:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.zatozolu.com/what-zach-is-doing/wsl-kali">
            If you have access to the Windows Store, use it to install the Linux distribution(s) desired (simply search for Kali, Ubuntu, etc.) then click install.  This method is much easier and these seem to be updated more regularly than those in the 'Manual Installation' downloads page from step 1 (and by that, I mean at all)
        </blockquote>
        <p>If there is only a short string of text to quote, <q>this is a better way to cite it</q> than a full blockquote</p>
        <p>I don't really understand the purpose of this, but <abbr title="ZaToZoLu">ZTZL</abbr> can be abbreviated</p>
